<h1>Hypertext Terms</h1>
<p>This is a glossary of terms used within the <a href="index.html">WWW</a> project. In most cases, their use corresponds to converntional use in hypertext circles.</p>
<h2>Anchor</h2>
<p>An area within a the content of a <a href="">node</a> which is the source or destination of a link . The anchor may be the whole of the node content. Typically, clicking a mouse on an anchor area causes the link to be followed,<br>
    leaving the anchor at the opposite end of the link displayed. Anchors tend to be highlighted in a special way (always, or when the mouse is over them), or represented by a special symbol. An anchor may, and often<br>
    does, correspond to the whole node. (also sometimes known as "span", "region", "button", or "extent").
</p>
<h2>Annotation</h2>
<p>The linking of a new commentary <a href="">node</a> to an existing node. If readers can annotate nodes, then they can immediately provide feedback if the information is misleading, out of date or plain wrong. Thus the quality of<br>
    the information in the <a href="">web</a> can be improved. <a href="">(More...)</a>
</p>
<h2>Authoring</h2>
<p>A term for the process of writing a document. "Authoring" seems to have come into use in order to emphasise that document production involved more than just writing.</p>
<h2>Back link</h2>
<p>A link in one direction implied from the existence of an explicit limk in the other direction. See: <a href="backlinks.html">Building back-links</a> </p>
<h2>Browser</h2>
<p>A program which allows a <a href="">person</a> to read <a href="">hypertext</a>. The browser gives some means of viewing the contents of <a href="">nodes</a>, and of <a href="">navigating</a> from one node to another.</p>
<h2>Button</h2>
<p>An <a href="">anchor</a> which is the source of a <a href="">link</a>. Often, but not always, represented on screen to look like a push-button.</p>
<h2>Card</h2>
<p>An alternative term for a <a href="">node</a> in a system (e.g. HyperCard, Notecards) in which the node size is limited to a single page of a limited size.</p>
<h2>Client</h2>
<p>A program which requests services of another program. Normally, the <a href="">browser</a> is a client of a data server.</p>
<h2>Database</h2>
<p>We have used this vaguely as a term for a collection of nodes . We imagine management information for one of these being kept in one place and all being accessible by the same ,<a href="">server</a>. <a href="">Links</a> outside this are <br>
    "external", and those inside are "internal". We do not imply anything about how the information shored be stored.
</p>
<h2>Daemon</h2>
<p>A program which runs independently of, for example the <a href="">browser</a> . Daemons may perform various management tasks such as <a href="">building indexes</a>,  overviews, and <a href="">back-links</a> . Under unix, "daemon" is used for "<a href="">server</a>", <br>
    because servers normally run independently.
</p>
<h2>Document</h2>
<p>A term for a <a href="">node</a> on some systems (eg Intermedia). Sometimes used by others as a term for a collection of nodes on related topics, possible stored or distributed as one. The prefered term in W3 documentation.</p>
<h2>Domain</h2>
<p>We have used this specifically for a unit of protection. It could possibly correspond to a <a href="">database</a> , and in that case would be a better (less vague) term for it.</p>
<h2>External</h2>
<p>A <a href="">link</a> to a <a href="">node</a> in a different database. See <a href="">Database</a> </p>
<h2>Host</h2>
<p>A computer on a network. We use this term rather than the term " <a href="">node</a>" which is often used for a document in a hypertext <a href="">web</a>. </p>
<h2>Hypermedia</h2>
<p>MultiMedia <a href="">Hypertext</a> . HyperMedia and HyperText tend to be used loosely in place of each other. Media other than text typically include graphics, sound, and video. <a href="hypermedia.html">(More...)</a> </p>
<h2>Hypertext</h2>
<p>Text which is not constrained to be linear. <a href="hypermedia.html">(More...)</a> </p>
<h2>Index</h2>
<p>Something which points at other data; a server facility which provides pointers to particular data as a function of a query; a table of contents of a book in hypertext form. <a href="moreindex.html">(More...)</a> </p>
<h2>Internal</h2>
<p>A <a href="">link</a> to a <a href="">node</a> in the same <a href="">database</a>. See <a href="">database</a>. </p>
<h2>Link</h2>
<p>A relationship between two <a href="">anchors</a>, stored in the same or different <a href="">database</a> . See <a href="">"Internal"</a> and <a href="external.html">"External"</a> </p>
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>The process of moving from one node to another through the hypertext <a href="">web</a> . This is normally done by following <a href="">links</a> . Various features of a particular <a href="">browser</a> may make this easier. These include keeping a history <br>
    of where the user has been, and drawing diagrams of links between nearby nodes. <a href="">(More...)</a>
</p>
<h2>Node</h2>
<p>A unit of information. Also known as a frame (KMS), card (Hypercard, Notecards). Used with this special meaning in hypertext circles: do not confuse with "node" meaning "network host". For user's benefits, we <br>
    use the term "<a href="">document</a>" as this is the nearest term outside the hypertext world.
</p>
<h2>Protection</h2>
<p>The prevention of unauthorized users from reading, or writing, a particular piece of data. Also known as "authentication", "access control", etc. <a href="">(More...)</a> </p>
<h2>Path</h2>
<p>An ordered set of nodes or anchors which represent a sequence in which a <a href="">web</a> can be read. A path may represent the sequence a reader actually used, or may be a sequence recommened to the reader by the author.</p>
<h2>Reader</h2>
<p>We have used this term for the person who browses, to distinguish him/her from the program (<a href="">browser</a>) which (s)he uses.</p>
<h2>Server</h2>
<p>A program which provides a service to another, known as the <a href="">client</a> . In a <a href="">hypertext</a> system, a server will provide hypertext information to a <a href="">browser</a> . See also: <a href="">daemon</a> </p>
<h2>Tracing</h2>
<p>The automatic finding of nodes by automatic <a href="">navigation</a> . Examples might be finding all nodes dependent on another node, all people interested in a given node, all modules which use a given module. Another <br>
    example is a trace starting with more than one node, such as to find a node in common between two groups, or path linking two nodes.
</p>
<h2>Topology</h2>
<p>The allowable connectivity between nodes, anchors and links: for example, 1-1 or many-1 mappings. <a href="">(More...)</a> </p>
<h2>Versioning</h2>
<p>The storage and management of previous versions of a piece of information, for security, diagnostics, and interest. This is important when many users are allowed to edit the same material. <a href="">(More...)</a> </p>
<h2>Web</h2>
<p>A set of <a href="">nodes</a> interconnected by <a href="">links</a> . Often, the set of all the nodes which are interconnected. See also <a href="">Topology</a>. </p>
