<h1>What is HyperText</h1>
<p>Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.</p>
<p>Hypertext is text which contains <a href="links.html">links</a> to other texts. The term was coined by <a href="tednelson.html">Ted Nelson</a> around 1965 (see <a href="history.html">history</a>). </p>
<p>HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and <a href="sound.html">sound</a> , for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.</p>
<p>Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.</p>
